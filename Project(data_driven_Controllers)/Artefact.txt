7.1	Artefacts

The Artefacts are developed using MATLAB R2002b and Simulink, please use R2002b or later version of MATLAB for reproduction of these Artefacts. 
The three main Artefacts can be found here:
Cryostat Model in MATLAB format:
	Artefact\src\CryostatModel\cryostatModel.mat
MPC Model in MATLAB format:
	Artefact\src\MPC\MPC.mat
GAPID tuner:
	git\Artefact\src\GAPID\gaPID_RUN.m
To recreate Cryostat model:
To recreate these models, take the close loop data in “\Artefact\src\data\AutoPIDData\ EM_LS336_pid_autoPID_FullRangeExperiment_C.dat” clean the data using “Artefact\src\dataCorrection\DataCorrection.ipynb”. Import the resulting data into MATLAB’s system identification. Separate the 10K step data into 6 sections using the “select range” function, fit each of section using “process models” with the transfer function defined in the report. Finally export the model to MATLAB workspace.
To recreate MPC controllers:
To recreate these controllers, load the cryostat Models into the MATLAB/Simulink and run Artefact\src\MPC\createMPC.m. You will need to change the name of the plant array to match the name of your cryostat Model.
To test the GAPID tuner:
Change the model’s name in the script to test different cryostat model and run:
git\Artefact\src\GAPID\gaPID_RUN.m
7.1.1	Python controller

To run the controller to collect data, simply setup the cryostat as described in the report and change the Lakeshore IP/EPIC IP address in the script and run it, all the script are located here:
	Artefact\src\run
The python code for the controller is located here:
Artefact\src\Control
7.2	Data

To generate the data shown in this report run:
git\Artefact\src\GAPID\ pidSimWithModel.m
for GAPID and for MPC run:
	Artefact\src\MPC\setT.m
APID data is located here:
	“\Artefact\src\data\AutoPIDData\EM_LS336_pid_autoPID_FullRangeExperiment_C.dat”
Open loop data can be found here:
	“\Artefact\src\data\OpenLoop”	
All the data collected during this project can be found here:
	\Artefact\src\data
